But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
Is it just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay
Tell me, who I have to be
To get some reciprocity
See no one loves you more than me and no one ever will.
No matter how deep we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
This is crazy

I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we've got to do
You let go and I'll let go too
Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will
No matter how deep we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
This is crazy
Oh this is crazy

Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me give to me
Why don't you live for me.

Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually
(2x)

I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game,
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? We're so confused
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
From the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper / actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture
Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now, everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves then we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication

Let me tell ya that,
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
How can I make U see that it's cool?
Can't U just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend, U could
Oh yeah, I think so
Listen, 4 U naked I would dance a ballet
Would that get U off?
Tell me what will
If I was your girlfriend, would U tell me?
Would U let me see U naked then?
Would U let me give U a bath?
Would U let me tickle U so hard U'd laugh and laugh
And would U, would U let me kiss U there

Have mercy, baby on a poor girl like me,
You know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet,
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes,
So help me, help me, help me make the feeling go.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Have pity baby,
Just when I thought it was over,
Now you got me running, running, running for cover.
I'm begging you for a little sympathy,
'Cause if you use me again it'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Baby, baby, hope you're gonna stay away,
'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday,
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be,
And if you use me again it'll be the end of me.

'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,
And there's not another living soul around,
Then you woo me until the sun comes up,
And you say that you love me.

Intense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
I think she knew
The people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel

She asked me
Be my sister, sister of the moon
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
Wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ah, know her name

So we make our choices
When there is no choice
And we listen to their voices
Ignoring our own voice

All it took was a special look
And I felt I knew you before
Didn't mean to love you
Didn't think it would work out

But I knew we would be together
And I couldn't wait for more
But what can they say
It's not against the law

I don't hold you down
Maybe that's why you're around
But if I'm the one you love
Think about me.

I believe that you really want me
But it's not easy, just to give in
So let yourself go, and let love begin.

Hark, now hear the sailors cry
Smell the sea and feel the sky
Let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic
And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home
And when that fog horn blows I want to hear it
I don't have to fear it
I want to rock your gypsy soul
Just like way back in the days of old
Then magnificently we will float into the mystic
And when that fog horn blows you know I will be coming home
And when that fog horn whistle blows I got to hear it
I don't have to fear it

Hang onto your head and give it a try

To live you must nearly die
Giving up the need to say ""I""

Have a need to identify
All of us want to be satisfied
Few people seem to care
Livin' a life that leads nowhere

Now where the wheel might roll
Is where my love and I shall go.
We're gonna plant the seed,
There ain't nothing we need,
We found our own rainbow.

My love wants to have her fortune read
And I know that she's in a hurry.
If we go along the straight and narrow,
You don't even have to worry.

We've got time to kill,
Standin' still,
Go on, give it a try!

Don't eat no caviar.

We take to the nest
You know where we are.

Thinkin' that I might have drove you too far.
And I'm thinkin' 'bout the love that you laid on my table.

I told you not to wander 'round in the dark.
I told you 'bout the swans, that they live in the park.
Then I told you 'bout our kid, now he's married to Mabel.

Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down.
Don't you notice how the wheel goes 'round?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.

She didn't have the time to wait in the queue.
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradle.

For the old wound
Now forgotten.

Twice upon a time in the valley of the tears
An auctioneer is bidding for a box of fading years
And the elephants are dancing on the graves of squealing mice.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the ice creams are all melting on the streets of bloody beer
While the beggars stain the pavements with flourescent Christmas cheer
And the Bentley-driving guru is putting up his price.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

And the prophets in the boutiques give out messages of hope
With jingle bells and fairy tales and blind colliding scopes
And you can tell they're all the same underneath the pretty lies.
Anyone for tennis, wouldn't that be nice?

The yellow Buddhist monk is burning brightly at the zoo
You can bring a bowl of rice and then a glass of water too
And fate is setting up the chessboard while death rolls out the dice.

He never has the time to turn around
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere
He seems to be completely unaware

The traveller is always leaving home
The only kind of life he's ever known
When every moment seems to be
A race against the time
There's always one more mountain left to climb

Watch the stars
We can only see so far

you'll know where you are
Remember
Days are numbers
Count the stars

One day

He doesn't know what's on the other side
But something deep inside of him
Keeps telling him to go
He hasn't found a reason to say no

The traveller is only passing through
He cannot understand your point of view
Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find
The traveller in me is close behind

Standing alone my senses real
A fatal attraction holding me fast how
Can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Just an earth-bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings
I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul
Right through the roof of the night

Suspended animation, a state of bliss

it's rolling round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
but that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Anton..
When I was just a baby my mama told me. Son,
always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry..

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
they're probally drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigarrs.
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
but those people keep a movin'
and that's what tortures me...

Well if they'd free me from this prison,
if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line
far from Folsom prison is where I want to stay
and I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.....",en,Johnny Cash,Folk; Country; Rock,557.0,14.1,/johnny-cash/,1968-08-10,46.0,32.0,12.0

And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame.
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name.

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry,
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon on a street of mud,
There at a table, dealing stud,
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had,
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old,
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now your gonna die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise,
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when,
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first,
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.

And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along.
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong.""

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
But ya ought to thank me, before I die,
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue.'""

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son,
And I came away with a different point of view.
And I think about him, now and then,
Every time I try and every time I win,
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

Number one - County Chart; Number 42 - Pop Chart

I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' behind every cloud
Just poor people that's all we were
Tryin' to make a livin' out of blackland earth
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud ...

CHORUS
Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne ...

No, the circle won't be broken
Bye and bye, Lord, bye and bye ...
Daddy'll sing bass, Mama'll sing tenor
Me and little brother will join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

Now I remember after work,
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singin' for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while.

CHORUS
Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song

Grew restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust
Who really meant no harm
He changed his clothes and shined his boots
And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out

Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town

He laughed and kissed his mom and said
Your Billy Joe's a man
i can shoot as quick and straight as
anybody can
but i wouldn't shoot without a cause
i'd gun no body down
but his mother cried as he rode away

Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town. ""

He sang a song as on he rode
His guns hung at his hips
He rode into a cattle town
A smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again

Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town. ""

He drank his first strong liquor then
to calm his shaking hands
And tried to tell himself
at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mother's words

Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't take your guns to town

Filled with rage, then, Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun
and fired before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
the crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words

Why you never see bright colors on my back,
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.

I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
But is there because he's a victim of the times.

I wear the black for those who never read,
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
About the road to happiness through love and charity,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.

Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.

I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.

And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side.

Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
And things need changin' everywhere you go,
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
You'll never see me wear a suit of white.

Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from all around.
And all the girls from there to Austin,

To take the trip, to go and listen,
To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
And all the girls from nine to ninety,
Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: ""Don't stop.""
And hypnotized and fascinated,
By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
But all the girls still dreamed about him.
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
And then one day on the Hit Parade,
Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.

And he would play: (Instrumental.)

A pickin' singin' folk group
They sang the mountain ballads
And the folk songs of our land

They were long on musical ability
Folks thought they would go far
But political incompatibility led to their downfall

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear was a Methodist

This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
Singing the traditional ballads
And the folk songs of our land
They performed with great virtuosity
And soon they were the rage
But political animosity prevailed upon the stage

Well, the one on the right was on the left
And the one in the middle was on the right
And the one on the left was in the middle
And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license

Well the curtain had ascended
A hush fell on the crowd
As thousands there were gathered to hear The folk songs of our land
But they took their politics seriously
And that night at the concert hall
As the audience watched deliriously
They had a free-for-all

Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
And the one in the middle was on the top
And the one on the left got a broken arm
And the guy in the rear, said, ""Oh dear""

Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
Just work on harmony and diction
Play your banjo well
And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself

Now, the one on the left works in a bank
And the one in the middle drives a truck
The one on the right's an all-night deejay
And the guy in the rear got drafted

Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
'this could be heaven or this could be hell'
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...

Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the hotel california
Any time of year,
You can find us here

She got the mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys,
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard,
Sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember,
Some dance to forget

'please bring me my wine'

'we haven't had that spirit here
Since nineteen sixty nine'

Wake you up in the middle of the night

Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the hotel california
What a nice surprise,
Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said: 'we are all just prisoners here,
Of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
She drives on through the night anticipating
'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel

She swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever

I burned up my childhood days.
I learned of all the rules of the modern-day drifter,
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long.
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them,
With the words of a sad country song.
My heroes have always been cowboys.
And they still are, it seems.
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of,
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams.

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery,
From being alone too long.
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare,
Knowin' well that your best days are gone.
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen,
I let the words of my years fade away.
Old worn-out saddles, and 'old worn-out memories,
With no one and no place to stay.

My heroes have always been cowboys.
And they still are, it seems.

The secret of life is try not to hurry,
but don't wait.
Don't wait.

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee,
the secret of life is keep your eye on the ball.
The secret of life is to find the right woman,
the secret of life is nothing at all.
(Oh it's nothin' at all.)
The secret of life...

Other one says ""That won't get you too far.""

She was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it, She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, She melted them, as she brought them to their feet

She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke everynight
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star


She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs, like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke everynight
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girl friends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they are
And where she is now

Her old neighbors swear they're certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you've got something they ain't got

So she sings tonight
To 20 thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud,
""Man that could be us""

She's a big star
And she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight

Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonights the night, feels like perfect timin'
Down on one knee on momma's front steps,
Man I'm gonna die if she really says yes

I wanna know how forever feels

""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams,
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause everytime I hear that song...

I go back to a two-toned short bed Chevy
Drivin my first love out to the levy
Livin life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rockin Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just tryin to impress the ladies
I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Cause every time I hear that song....

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew,preacher, and a choir
Singin bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back, I go back

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine, I go back
I go back

To watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall, I go back
I go back

To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him, I go back
I go back

Rollin high and mighty trapped
Countless violent flaming roads

Proud 'neath heated brow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

Half wracked prejudice leaped forth
""Rip down all hate"" I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic flanks of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
Sisters fled by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah but I was so much older then
I'm younger than that now

My guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

Chorus:
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

He was walking by the other day and I said
Hey baby...how you been?
Yeah, I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
You only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave my heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother
And he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that

Repeat Chorus

You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
An' We got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean, white shirt,
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone...all I could say is

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
And I can't explain it, and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty and together we'll make a stand

Somewhere 'cross the parking lot, some bands playin' out of tune
City streets are gonna burn if we don't do something soon
Senorita can't quit crying, baby's due now any day
Don Juan left, got sick of trying...no one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store and
She said I, I wanna buy a little carton of milk, but I don't have any money
I said Hey I'll cover you honey, cause the pain's gotta go somewhere
Yeah the pains gotta go someplace...
So come on down to my house
Don't ya know that

You can hide beneath the covers
Or you can run outside,head up high

Time turns a wheel and love collides
Faith is believing you can close your eyes
Touch the sky!
Shine while you have the chance to shine
Laugh even when you want to cry
Hold on tight to what you feel inside
And ride!

It brings you up slowly
Then shoots you like a rocket towards the ground
It twists you and it shakes you
Before it turns you upside down
You can't see what's around the corner
And you can't look back so just live it up
And feel the rush

After all my heart had put me through,
I knew that it was safe with you.
What we had would never end.

They'd seen this before.
We'd be fine.
And you'd come to see,

It's something that he's going through,
Happens to a lot of men.
And I told myself that they were right,
That you'd wake up and se the light,
And i'd just have to wait 'til then.

You want me to forget, pretend we've never met
And I've tried and I've tried but I haven't yet

And then someday
You'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry
Wond'rin'

Crazy

I'm crazy for tryin'
Crazy for cryin'
And I'm crazy
For lovin' you

As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinkin' of
As I read the lines that, to me, were so dear
I remember our faded love

(Chorus)
I miss you darlin', more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars the above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

(Repeat Chorus)

And remember our faded love

Imagine me still lovin' you

Well, I can't help it, I just do
Imagine that, and that's not the half

Imagine this, if you can
I've stood more, more than I should stand
But I'd still take you back again
Imagine that, ain't that a laugh

Can you believe I'd swallow my pride
Well, yes, yes, I guess you can
'Cause you know you've always had my foolish heart
Right in the palm of your hand

So, for what it's worth to you
It just don't matter what you might do

I should know I'll never wear your ring

And here comes the blues
I can't convince myself that
We're really thru
Who can I count on

The door to happiness was almost open
Just one more step or two and I'd be in
Then all at once the vows you made were broken
The door to happiness was closed again

And if your heart is breaking think how I must feel

It wasn't any secret i'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting in the living room by myself
with at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf

Chorus:
She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Running through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancing with her dad, looking up at him
In her eyes i'm Prince Charming
But to him i'm just some fella
riding in and stealing Cinderella


I leaned in towards those pictures to get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say \""Now, ain't she something, son?\""
I said \""Yes, she quite a woman\""
and he just stared at me
Then I realized that in his eyes she would always be

He slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him

/lady-gaga/,Born This Way,/lady-gaga/born-this-way.html,"""This is the manifesto of Mother Monster
On Goat, a government-owned alien territory and space
A birth of magnificent and magical proportions took place
But the birth was not finite
It was infinite
As the womb slumbered
And the mitosis of the future began
It was perceived that this infamous moment in life
is not temporal
It is eternal
And thus began the beginning of the new race
A race within the race of humanity
A race which bares no prejudice
No judgement, but boundless freedom
But on that same day
As the eternal mother hovered in the multiverse
Another more terrifying birth took place
The birth of evil
And as she herself split into two
Rotating in agony between two ultimate forces
The pendulum of joice began its dance
It seems easy to imagine
To gravitate instantly and unwaveringly towards good
But she wondered
How can I protect something so perfect without evil? ""

And climb to the roof

Never one without the other

Sometimes when I miss you
I put those records on

Saw you downtown
Singing the blues

Want to wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling

At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here

Waiting for your change of heart...

Blind leading blind
Never hear the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If it's truth that you're looking to find
It is nowhere outside of your mind
I bide my time

Together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her
Made me shiver
'cause he always used to
Look at me that way

Maybe I should walk
Right up to her and say
It's a game he likes to play

Look into his angeleyes

He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out
He wears a disguise
Don't look too deep
Into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no

Sometimes when I'm lonely
I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember
All the good times
When I thought I
Could never live without him
And I wonder
Does it have to be the same
Every time
When I see him
Will it bring back all the pain
How can I forget that name

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart
And you must pay the price

And this heart that will see you through

It`s no secret, it`s no secret
It`s no secret, it`s no secret
It`s no secret, it`s no secret
It`s no secret, it`s no secret

When I 1st met U, how U changed my life that day
But with each 2morrow U just seem 2 drift away
Then I discovered that U were cheating
U were cheating on me
But I was the last 2 know

Our love was a lie
And it`s no secret, it`s no secret
How U hurt me inside
And it`s no secret because U told everybody

Didnt I really love U, U know I gave U all my heart
When I put my arms around U I never thought we`d ever part
Then I discovered, I guess U couldn`t love me
Like U said U loved me, O no
Why was I the last 2 know

Our love was a lie
And it`s no secret, it`s no secret
How U hurt me inside
And it`s no secret because U told everybody

All of my life I was looking 4 someone just like U
U shattered my dreams, tore me apart, what can I do?
But I was the last 2 know

Our love was a lie
And it`s no secret, it`s no secret
How U hurt me inside
And it`s no secret because U told everybody
Our love was a lie
And it`s no secret, it`s no secret
How U hurt me inside
And it`s no secret because U told everybody

We are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth
I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine

When I been over I been under
I don't own a dream to analyze
But living eyes you know that I do
believe in the soul and the magic of you

Living eyes, when under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes, when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love

We are of age,we are in time
We are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth
I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine

Living eyes
When under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart

Were the windows of my soul
You could always fill my love
And pain without been told
I never knew how, but I don't
Even dare to look at you now.

So, if you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we leave
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry, ooh baby,
Walk on by, ooh darling
Please, Walk on by,
I don't wanna you to see me cry
Walk on by, please, please
Baby, baby don't stop...

So, if you ever love
Look the other way
There is anything left to say
Anyway...

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goobye, ooh baby
Walk on by, ooh sugar
Walk on by...(baby, baby don't stop)

Baby, baby don't stop

Walk on by...ub..eh

Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by..uuh baby
Walk on by...uuh sugar
Walk on by... walk on by

Walk on by, walk on by...

I don't have nothing left to say...
Please take your head... look the other way...

/the-isley-brothers/,Spill The Wine,/the-isley-brothers/spill-the-wine.html,"I was once out strolling
One hot summer day
When I thought I'd lay
Myself down to rest

In a big field
Of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and I
Felt it caressin' my face

As I fell asleep
I dreamed that I was in a hollywood movie
And that I was the star
Of the movie

This really blew my mind
But there I was
Oh yeah I was
I was taken to the place
The hall of the mountain king

I stood high upon the mountaintop
Naked to the world
In front of me
Was every kind of girl

There was long ones, tall ones
Short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones
Big crazy ones

Out of the middle
Came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Somethin' crazy
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
Spill the wine; take that pearl
I thought to myself
What could this mean?
Am I going crazy
Or is it just a dream?

Now wait a minute
I know I'm lying
In a field of grass somewhere
It was all in my head
But then I heard
Somebody say

I could feel hot flames
Of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared
But soon she returned

In her hand was a bottle of wine
And in the other, a glass
Good God

She poured some of that wine
From the bottle into the glass
And she raised it to her lip
And before she drank it, she said

Spill, spill, spill that wine
Come on, take that pearl
Come on and spill that wine
Come on and take that pearl

Spill that wine!
Spill, spill, spill
Spill, spill, spill that wine

I was cruisin' with my favourite gang
The place was so boring
Filled with out-of-towners touring
I knew that it wasn't my thing
I really wasn't caring
But I felt my eyes staring
At a guy who stood out in the crowd
He had the kind of body
That would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man cry
Oh... what... wow ! He's the greatest dancer
Oh... what... wow ! That I've ever seen...
The champion of dance
His moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit
As a man who is complete(ly)
My crème de la crème
Please take me (don't go) home
He wears the finest clothes
The best designers, heaven knows
Ooh, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci
He looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill
Oh... what... wow ! He's the greatest dancer
Oh... what... wow ! That I've ever seen...

Is where I search for the light,
Pick up my pen and start to write,
I struggle a fight,
Dark forces in the clear moonlight without fear,
Insomnia.

I can't get no sleep.

I used to worry,
Thought I was going mad in a hurry,
Getting stressed, making excess
mess in darkness. No electricity,
Something's all over me, greasy.
Insomnia please release me,
And let me dream of making mad love to my girl on the heath,
Tearing off tights with my teeth.
But there's no release, no peace,
I toss and turn without cease.
Like a curse,

And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low.

You know the nights magic, seems to whisper and hush,
You know the soft moonlight, seem to shine-In your blush
Can I just have one more moondance with you-my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you-my love?

Well I wanna make love to you tonight,
I can't wait till the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right,
and straight into my arms you will run.
And when you come my heart will be waiting,
to make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true dear,
There and then I will make you my own.

And everytime i touch you-you just tremble inside
then i know how much you want to want me that-
you cant hide
Can I just have one more moondance with you-my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you-my love?

Went out looking for the rainbow
You know what did they learn
Since that very day

Walking by the river
And running like a blue streak
Through the fields of streams and meadows
Laughing all the way

Oh redwood tree
Please let us under
When we were young we used to go
Under the redwood tree

And it smells like rain
Maybe even thunder
Won't you keep us from all harm
Wonderful redwood tree

And a boy and his father
Went out, went out looking for the lost dog
You know what oh haven't they learned
Since they did that together
They did not bring him back
He already had departed
But look at everything they have learned
Since that, since that very day

Oh redwood tree

Maybe even thunder
Won't you keep us from all harm

I look to everybody but me to answer my prayers
’Til I saw an angel in a bathroom
Who said she saw no one worth saving anywhere
And a blind man on the corner said it's simple, like flipping a coin
Don't matter what side it lands on if it's someone else's dime

I got a ticket in my hand
And then a man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand

Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here

There's a burning bush to my right

Do you want me
Like I want you?

Beneath the darkened sky
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by
Or am I standing still
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you
Passing me by

Mother's on the stoop
Boys in souped up coupes
On this hot summer night
Between fight and flight
Is the blind man's sight
And a choice that's right
I roll the window down
Feel like I'm
I'm gonna drown
In this strange town
Feel broken down
I feel broken down
Do you need me

Thinks only of you.

And be just differently used.

So hard to laugh as I fumbled

Torment from a child who knew

Virgil Caine is the name, and I DROVE on the Danville train,
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and tore up the tracks again.
In the winter of '65, We were hungry, just barely alive.
I TOOK THE TRAIN, Richmond had fell, it WAS a time I remember, oh so well,

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the ALL THE bells were ringing,
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the ALL THE people were singin'. They went
La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La,

Back with my wife in Tennessee, When one day she SAID to me,
""Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee!""
Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if the money's no good.
JUST take what ya need and ya leave the rest,
But they should never have taken the very best.

(Chorus)

Like my father before me, I will work the land,
AND Like my brother above me, I took a rebel stand.
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, But a Yankee laid him in his grave,
I swear by the BLOOD below my feet,
You can't raise THE Caine back up when he's in defeat.

alle congregazioni â€œbiancheâ€ protestanti degli Stati Uniti del sud. Eâ€™ stata
pubblicata per la prima volta come Inno negro in una versione modificata, nei
primi anni dello scorso secolo. Usata, nella forma attuale, negli anni â€˜40 come
inno â€œsindacaleâ€ dai lavoratori degli Alimentari e del Tabacco del
Sud-Carolina, e successivamente dai lavoratori delle scuole popolari del
Tennessee. Eâ€™ usata tradizionalmente per chiudere tutti i congressi

a bit about how to give and take

As every fairy tale comes real, I've looked at love that way

And if you care don't let them know, don't give yourself away

No wedding Saturday within the month of June.

No harvest moon to light one tender August night.
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern sky.

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.

There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see

For you
There might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me",en,Stevie Wonder,R&B; Soul Music; Funk,254.0,12.2,/stevie-wonder/,1977-10-08,32.0,32.0,7.0
/stevie-wonder/,As,/stevie-wonder/as.html,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky

My life grew sweeter through the years.

I had the fever with each passing year.

If this whole world crumbles,
By her side I'll still be standing there.

Has an air of great power

But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is Do or Die
Ah-ha-ha

Hard to understand
What a hell of a man
This cat of the slum
Had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown
'Cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own
But the man lived alone

The game he plays he plays for keeps
Hustlin' times and ghetto streets
Tryin' to get over

Taking all that he can take
Gambling with the odds of fate
Tryin' ta get over (4x)

Was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream
What does it mean?
He woudn't know

And there's no happiness

It only takes a second, to pop the trunk
And just like that you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed
It's all about the game, and nothin else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
You catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
Tryin to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin
This little town is gettin wild as hell
Check the penetentiaries and all the jails
If they could lock us all up that would be just fine
Got my partners from Oakland doin serious time
You can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
But it's a mindgame, and you gotta deal with that
I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money, cause back in the days
when I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone, and show you how
But I was broke, the only thing I had was game
I started makin money and knew things would change
Bought a Benz, thought it might earn respect
But the OPD, found it hard to accept
I got jacked by the Task and jacked by the Vice
Face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
Put the handcuffs on backseat I'm in it
Illegal search for about thirty minutes
Askin me, where's the dope
Where's my gun, but I don't know
I said I'm rappin, they laugh like I told a joke
And to this day they think I'm sellin coke

I want to be free! (and that's the truth) Ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! Ohhh yeahhh

I be in Oakland California every day of my life
bass so hard you think I'm smokin a pipe
And if I don't smoke it, I gots to grind
Searched all my stuff, and all you find
is a pocket full of money count seven G's
Now you wanna think I'm sellin keys
Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police wanna send me to prison
They see a brother makin major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass
And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin on the dank smoke
Cause all they wanna find, is guns and coke
In court all the time tryin to fight it
We get rich, we get indeibted
So what's the problem Officer this time?
Is havin big money bein black a crime?
Or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
Charge me with somethin, or just ask questions
About the brothers I hang around
What's really goin on in the Oakland town
Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But Too baby just ain't no snitch
You say you're just doin your job
But you're gettin on my nerves, just like Bob
Everytime I hit a corner, I see you
Always tellin brothers what to do
You lock me up cause I don't know how to act
But I'm down for mine so I be talkin back
And when I do, you treat me bad as hell
I'm sick of spendin nights in jail

I want to be free! (and that's the truth) Ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! Ohhh yeahhh

Got out of jail about fo'-fifteen
Walkin down the street like a broke dopefiend
Had a pocket full of money tryin to play the role
Benz got towed and I was hella cold
But I ain't trippin, I'm gettin used to it now
Handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
for three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
Cause the five-oh's always tryin to jack a playa
for no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong
You think I'm lyin, singin that same ol song
Well I'm a black man, ridin in a Benz
How in the hell did I make these ends? Here we go
I pull over to the right
Stop the engine keep my hands in sight
I start cursin, cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence
If I was plannin, a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank
And I hope I don't get robbed by you know who
Make me donate some G's to the boys in blue
And if I sue, I won't get nothin back
But I ain't mad... I'm just black...

I wish I would've known
Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye

I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I care
Or thank my pops for all the talks
And all the wisdom he shared

Unaware, I just did what I always do
Everyday, the same routine
Before I skate off to school

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking a test
I took two to the chest

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running
But I couldn't hear nothing

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid
But I sat by him in class

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
Or maybe for a moment
He forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was
I know it's because

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud
But no respect for herself

She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations
just different faces

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules
So you would think he was cool

He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end
They might remember him then

You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt
With the sound of the gat

We are, We are, (We are) the youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim
No matter what you say
It don't take away the pain

That I feel inside,
I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why
It's the blind leading the blind

I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense
Somebody's got to know

There's got to be more to life than this
There's got to be more to everything
I thought exists

Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please!

When you put up a parking lot

Dont it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got

When you put up a parking lot

Late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi
carried off my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
pave paradise
When you put up a parking lot

Taking all the pain to heart.
I hear you saying that you want to see changes,
But you don't know how to start.

Chorus:
Love will find a way, (How do you know?)
Love will find a way, (How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see the past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way.
I know that
Love will find a way, (A way to go.)
Love can make a way, (Only love can know.)
Leave behind the doubt;
Love's the only out;
Love will surely find a way.

I know this life is a strange thing.
I can't answer all the why's.
Tragedy always finds me,
Taken again by surprise.

I could stand here an angry young woman,
Taking all the pain to heart.
But I know that love can bring changes,
And so we've got to move on.

Came to rescue you,
Is there any circumstance
That He can't see you through?

I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face, I kissed her neck
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
""Why are you so far away,"" she said
""Why won't you ever know
that I'm in love with you,
That I'm in love with you?""

You... soft and only
You... lost and lonely
You... strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water, you're just like a dream
Just like a dream

Daylight whipped me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I open up my eyes
I find myself alone, alone, alone
Above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me.

Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me

Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light

Screamed at the sky

So lost in the cold

Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight
Droplets of ""yes"" and ""no""
In an ocean of ""maybe""

And I can see you clear

Have to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever

I danced in laughter with the everafter

The sound echoing closer
Will they come for me next time?

What can be saved, and who will be left to hold her?

Medals on a wooden mantle. Next to a handsome face.
That the president took for granted.
Writing checks that others pay.

And in all the madness. Thought becomes numb and naive.
So much to talk about. Nothing for to say.

Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save
Does not equate, and the truth's already out there

No king no queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know what I feel without a name
Head on without a care

Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And Everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

We've been through this such a long long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine
All mine

So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone?

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you

Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone?

And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
Nothing lasts forever
Even a cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody

That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen
to all that righteous talk
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

Reach back, remember with all your might

Silver lights shinin' down

Nothin' feels the same
All your dreams are strange
Love comes walkin' in

Waits for the opening
Simply pulls a string
Love comes walkin' in

Oh, sleep and dream; that's all I crave
I travel far across the milky way
To my master I become a slave
'til we meet again some other day

Where silence speaks as loud as war
Earth returns to what it was before

Left its seeds while I was sleeping

Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening

People writing songs
That voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
And the words that it was forming

And the sign said
""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

Because she was a Samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high

I had to touch and please her
Enjoy a little paradise
The log was in my pocket
When Lucy met the Rockett
And she never knew the reason why

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
It's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
It's not against the law
The point of no return
And now you know the score
And now you're learning
What's knockin' at your back door

Sweet Nancy was so fancy
To get into her pantry
Had to be the aristocracy
The members that she toyed with
At her city club
Were something in diplomacy
So we put her on the hit list
Of a common cunning linguist
A master of many tongues
And now she eases gently
From her Austin to her Bentley

And I was empty within
Hungry feeding on chaos and living in sin

And no love for another

Finding nothing but questions and devils

I was struck by the light
Aand I fell to the ground

If you let it in your heart

She is the girl of his dreams
He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'
He's got a pain in his heart he feels like crying
So lonesome for love he feels like dying

But don't stop the dream
He can fix it, I know he can
He's the world's world's greatest
At the work that he does
When he moves on down the line

(Chorus 1)

She is the girl of his dreams
He wants her, he thinks 'forget it'
He'd love to look inside her heart
And see if she agrees

But don't stop the dream
He can fix it, I know he can
He's good, he's great
At the work that he does
And there's magic in the air

(Chorus 2)
Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Everything'll work out if you let it
Let it in your heart

Good times, bad times don't know what to do
Half the time and all the time
Don't know if it's true
Someday, somewhere know if it's true
She'll look inside her heart and decide
It's really you..... whoah

I used to see those red tail lights, heading for another town
And wish that I was on my way
Looking back on these summer nights, wasting time, fooling 'round
And there was nothing here to make me stay

But that night I met you, the night you came through made me realise
There's no way I can leave, you made me believe
And now when I look in your eyes

Chorus:
I could walk through fire, I can feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, (to get) right back to you
And as the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
Baby I could walk through fire

It's crazy how these things work out, I used to think I had no chance
And I somehow thought you'd slip away
You pulled me through the fear and doubt, gave me all I'm looking for
Everything I needed to stay

How could something so good, something so simple, get serious
How could someone so right come into my life, and now I just want you to
know

Chorus:
I could walk through fire, I can feel it burning
And I could walk through fire, (to get) right back to you
And as the flames get higher, you know I'll get stronger
Baby I could walk through fire

And I would go anywhere, I would do anything, I do what you want me to
You know that I would, I want you to know this, whenever you need me
Ooh wherever you are, no matter how far, you know I'll be coming for you

How much there was to lose
I spelled it out, I led you to the water
But you're too blind to choose
I gave it everything and more to make it
I've waited for so long
I saw the chance to run and had to take it
But something's missing and I know it's wrong

I need your love
I want you every way
And I need your love
Can't help this feeling coming back everyday

I've passed the point of no return
And all the tears have dried
Don't want to stop and watch the bridges burn
'Cause I keep wishing I was on your side

I need your love
I want you every way
And I need your love
Can't help this feeling

I need your love
I want you every way
I need your love
Can't help this feeling coming back everyday

I am the one who couldn't last
I feel alive for the pain
I feel the anger changing me

Sometimes I can never tell
If I got something there for me
That's why I just hang in grief
For this, cuz you're leaving

Tell me, why am I to blame
Aren't we, supposed to be the same
That's why, I will never change
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Betrayed
I feel so, enslaved
I really tried
I did my time

I did my time
I did my time
I did my time
I did my time

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me

Okay, I've got a question.
""Can I throw it all away?""

There's real ones around me

I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency

Never thought I'd be talking from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups
Have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run
And send me a message
40, Did you get the message?
Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
Party just dipped off in a white porsche
And I just came from dinner
Where I ate some well done seared scallops
That were to die for

Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losing mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over chattanooga
Out here trying to spread the movement

I just got me the mercedes pullman

Back in the city, shit is getting brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle
Then take a girl to the movies
They've been dropping out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is working if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just making moves on your own time
But just know it'll be january in no time
And your absence is very concerning
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returning

Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during regular seasons
Paternity testing for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm michael jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoiding distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ah nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to closer to my dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changing, thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4, 000 Square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges
And nigga's crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and eli when niggas
Called me they brother the season start
And I don't wanna see you end up with nothing
Y'all throw the word ""family""
Around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was coming
They knees give out
And they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one getting buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becoming the crutches
Kids got on your number
Cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on tv look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they can to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringing me
And my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said
Was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact
That it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes
But not forget about you?
My plan was always to make
The product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets
Keep that shit to ourselves

That's when the phone starts ringin' like
""Are we straight? ""

All that Drake hysteria

[Outro: Sandi Graham]
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned
about this negative tone
that I'm hearing in your voice these days
I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from
and you have reason to question your anxieties
and how disillusioned you feel
as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe
you can trust
But that attitude will just hold you back in this life
and you're going to continue to feel alienated
Give some thought to this
because I'm confident in you
and I know you can reach your
desired destination and accomplish your goals
much more
quickly without this confrontation
I'm hearing in your tone

It's time when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missing out on my days
Scrolling through life and fishing for praise
Opinions from total strangers
Take me out of my ways
I'm tryna see who's there on the other end
Of the shade

Most times it's just somebody's that's underage
That's prolly just alone and afraid
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else
Can feel they pain
I always hear people complain
About the place they live
That all the people here fake
And they got nothin' to give
'cause they been starin'
At somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city
Seem more exciting than it is
I know a girl who's one goal was to visit rome
Then she finally got to rome
And all she did was post pictures
For people at home
'cause all that mattered was impressin'
Everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out
For help but her latest caption is
Leave me alone
I know a girl happily married
'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures
From places that she's flown
To post later
And make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hiding my kid from the world
I was hiding the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up
And looked the debate
Until you starin'
At your seat you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life
I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones
I can call
They always ask
Why let the story run if it's false?
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles
When you give 'em an inch
All these followers
But who gon' follow me to the end
I guess I'll make it to the end
And I'ma find out then

You've got me feeling emotions

I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first
but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more
when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean
it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all
when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy
and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin'
and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin'
even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Sandy used to tell me all it takes it one time
And all it took is one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times are nothing like the new times

Just making sure I see him sometimes

I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell them
I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different
Cause I've been through it
But this is the hardest truth now
Fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories
I tell you now
I don't want you worry about
Who's house you live at
Or who loves you more, or who's not there
Who did what to who for you before you got here
Now, look, I'm too pride to let
That come between you now
Realize I got a thing for two now
I better make it
I promise if I'm not there then I'm dedicated

Introduced you to saint nick

And believe me, I can't wait to get 100 more

Why would I say all these things
to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women
that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down
they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here
shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since take care, I've been caretakin'
At second chances, that ain't how you livin'

People don't wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I don't know if it's gonna be me that's gonna be coming back
Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that
Dropped out of school 'cause nobody was teaching that
The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at
Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts
Even if they make a movie 'bout us, this shit'll be hard to re-enact
Dislocated shoulder, it's hard to be always reaching back
All these IOU's, it's hard for me to be keeping track
Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin' me intact
Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back
All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat
All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at
All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed
At times he had to double back (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

There is no salary cap, there is no payin' him back, for real

Look, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line
And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline
Sometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind
I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time
Like, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?
They've been tryna push a narrative since '09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes
And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door 'fore I saw her put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die
So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)
My hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off
I'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff
Houses paid off, label paid off
My soul for the money wasn't the trade-off
Unlike most of you boys that fade off
I feel guilty taking some days off
Please don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off
I mean if you comparin' it to what I really made off with
I'm more like Bernie with all the earnest that they came off
Trust me it was nothin' light, holmes
They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home
I know you love me
Can't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on
Unless Kawhi wanna run it back
Other than that, the strings'll be unattached
Certified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that
Y'all music is watered down, will you love 'em back?
And you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters
Said you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard
Oh of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more
Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it
I'm always tryna rekindle
From the bottom the to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?
From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
To my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter
For the young Gs out here starting from the beginning

All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine
they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help

You don't gotta face it

They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got something left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's going in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna [?] the movements
gotta start to make 'em sooner

I dated women from my favorite movies

Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man

I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money
when I come for the shit like O. D. B

[Verse 2]
Who's hot, who not
Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp
Drake you know ain't nothing's changed
with these funny style niggas
We done put out of the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And its back to L. A
Open the mail, staring at the check
Enough to make you throw up
Man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could be Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it looks like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from?
I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my name Mordehigh
Fuck you bitch, I'm on that high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a. m. going shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead of time
I'm coming back on my worst behavior

I know, luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me
I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position
To reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
And fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys

I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because...

Chorus [Eminem]
These chickys
don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Eminem]
So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
""What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D-12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and the panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like siblin' rivalry
'cause they're back on stage the next night with me
""Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me""
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

[Swifty]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you?
Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
And what the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
all I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back

[Kuniva] Look him little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
[Kon Artis] Yeah I know man find himself takin' on a flick
[Kuniva] Hey I thought we had an interview with Dj Clue
[Eminem] No! I had an interview, not you two
[Kuniva] You gonna be late for soundcheck
[Kon Artis] Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
[Kuniva] But our mics are screwed up
[Kon Artis] And his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin'
[Kuniva] Aiyo Em (You got somethin' to say?!)
[Kon Artis] Man no
[Kuniva] I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man what's up
[Kon Artis] Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
[Kuniva] Man I was 'bout to talk right after you I swear, I
swear man

[Proof]
They say the lead singer's rock, but the group is not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement parks
I'ma go let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear... (Hey dude I love your band!)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys they can find every area code (Proof carry my
bag)
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

[Bizarre]
God damn it I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loop
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us a question
Like who's D-12, how we get started (But what about Eminem?)
Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy)
Then he told me to do sit-ups to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D-12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
and it just tares my ass apart to know that you don't know my
name

With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm

I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aww [shit], I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids (ahh!)
This room make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin weight
'Til I see dumb [shit] start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again

And when I'm, over weight and my golf ball broke

So i chose, huh
You got a phone,
Pick it up and call me

How come, we don't even talk no more',
And you don't even call no more',
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more',
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,
We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you

[Verse One]
What's up yall,
So full of life and vibrance,
Side by side wherever you was ridin’, I went,
So close or most us some Bonnie and Clyde shit,
When Ronnie died you was right by my side,
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,
You even had the same type of childhood I did,
Sometimes I just wanna know why,
Is it that you sur-came to yours,
And mine I survived it,
You ran the streets I nine to fived it,
We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,
Much as your pride tries to hide it,
You're cold your touch is just like ice,
And your eyes is the look of resentment,
I can sense it and I don’t like it

[Verse Two]
It was my dream at first to be all spittin the verse,
Sold my own album with a deal but shit got worse,
So I came out I would'a killed a nigga first,
'Fore I let him disrespect me,
Or check me up with somethin' worse,
Some bitch that I wasn't with,
I would'a hit her to would'a quit,
But you were plain talkin' to her,
And tell her she was the shit,
I told you don't get involved with her,
You were smoking the cron'c with her,
Coming out'a the bar with her,
Stumblin' hands drunk,
Like Devil's husband or wife or somthin',
But me catchin' he fuckin' other nigga,
Must've hurt your pride or somthin',
'Cause you wont fuck the mouth to people,
Like you want it with me,
When all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shifty,
And lyrics is the fans and all the shit that I produce,
You actin' like I ain't your man,
And lyin' like she can't be loose,
But I am really your friend,
I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
Don't hit the game other playa',

cuz my homie had to stop

shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home
see the devil in your grin, since the ghetto we been friends

I peep the hatred in your eyes and the Satan in your lie
aint wastin my time with these snakes in disguise

Doo-doo-doo, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm..

Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo YO..

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this

Gotta be somethin for me to write this

Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute

Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it

Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together

Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever

I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you

I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too

Because of you, feelings I handle with care

Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare

You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts

If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most

They say the end is near, it's important that we close..

.. to the most, high

Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times.. when you'll need someone..

I will be by your side..

There is a light, that shines,

special for you, and me..

Yo, yo, check it

It's important, we communicate

and tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch

I never call you my bitch or even my boo

There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man

And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land

But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write

from an East Coast shine night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall

Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all

Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall

For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything

friends will stay as we begin to lay

this foundation for a family - love ain't simple

Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually

Granted we known each other for some time

It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times.. when you'll need someone..

I will be by your side, oh darling

There is a light, that shines,

special for you, and me..

Yeah.. yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop

and I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop

Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh

Suggestin beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you

You know to give me space when it's time to

My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness

Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good

Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good

I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal

it's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'ma lead you

And whatever's right, I'ma feed you

Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da

Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times.. when you'll need someone..

I will be by your side..

There is a light, that shines,

special for you, and me..

(I'll) take my chances.. before they pass..

.. pass me by, oh darling..

You need to look at the other side..

I'm on 'til I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with' kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse

You've been warned if you've been born or if you can form
Slap up a cop and then snatch 'I'm out of his uniform
Leave him with' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn

Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past
So that basically resurrected my cashflow

I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s!
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily!

Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumpin' ""Ice, Ice Baby, "" screamin' Shady 'til I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady

Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Damn)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!

You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin',
Try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with' a capital B with' an exclamation mark, maybe

You should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'm a treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'm a kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'm a live this

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride

You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpse, Jack Kevorkian""

Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in

A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with' 5'9? to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown

Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips,

To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

It's gon' say ""The whole rap game passed away"" on top of the affadavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson' activator (Woo!)

Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)

There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down, sleep
Where the bar at?
[*crashing noise*]

[Verse 1]
Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more focus, hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer
Put her to the side and invite here to ""Cheers""
Pull up a chair, swear no drama
prepare for a player your workin with a MONSTER [*yelling*]
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masterbate
Why settle and wait
Let's Escalade to the nearest Super 8
To your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin booty cheeks
C'mon

[Chorus - 2X]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, [*sound of water dropping*], hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 2]
Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
She caught me starin
And my homies darin me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla cause I got a lot of denerio
The DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't wanna be headin home
With some double D's full of silicone
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I flipped out and they found me outside
Cussin' at the bitches screamin ""off to they rides!""

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Okay rolie polies everywhere [*horse naying noise*]
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literal [*crunching noise*]
-ly, like a box of Cheerios
Carrot cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split [*feet running away noise*]
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes

[Obie Trice - talking]
Word to mother, they god damn okra and beans
Got ya Oprah in jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

You gotta have teeth baby

Look, me big lips ..

Pay ya fare, fix ya hair, throw that pussy
Got Prada for my boonapalist, and (??) from Debussy(??)

Handle yo' business but I know you do it way better, you dead wrong

And I've been beatin that pussy up now it's smooth fuckin
You can betcha bottom dollar; if that pussy fire

Well hang on

Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hands, oh no
Don't throw your hands
If you feel like you're alone
no, no, no, you're not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
of this life, to hang on

Well everybody hurts,
sometimes, everybody cries,
And everybody hurts ...
sometimes
But everybody hurts sometimes

That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip
When the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just run away to somewhere else
Some place good
We can't wait 'till tomorrow

You gotta know that this is real, baby
Why you wanna fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose

Let's take a chance, baby, we can't lose
Ain't we all, just runaways

I knew it when I met you
I'm not gonna let you run away

I knew it when I held you
I wasn't letting go

We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other 'till the morning light
We used to laugh now we only fight
Baby, are you lonesome now?

At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt this house
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

We can't wait 'till tomorrow

Now we're caught up in the appeal
Baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

And we're all just runaways
I knew it when I met you
I'm not gonna let you run away

I knew it when I held you
I wasn't letting go

In circles if they tried,
A latent power I know they hide,
To keep some hope alive,

A phantom and a fly,
Follow the lines and wonder why

In cheap shots from the tribe,

And we're often in Marcus’ porch again,
Another afternoon with the gold head tunes,
And pilfered booze.

We wandered through your mama's house,
And the milk from the window lights,
Family portrait circa ninety-five,
This is that foreign land,
With the sprayed on tans,
And it all feels fine,
Beat it circa slime,

So, when they tap our mundane heads,
To zombie-walk in our stead,

I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.

I've lived a life that's full,
I travelled each and every highway.
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.

Regrets I've had a few,
But then again too few to mention.
I did what I had to do,
And saw it through without exemption.

I planned each chartered course,
Each careful step along the by way.
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.

Yes,
There were times,
I'm sure you knew,
When I bit off more than I could chew.

But through it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up, and spit it out.
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
And did it my way.

I've loved, I've laughed, and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing.
And now, as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.

To think I did all that,
And may I say, not in a shy way.
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way.

For what is a man, what has he got,
If not himself, then he has not
To say the things he truly feels,
And not the words of one who kneels.

The record shows,
I took the blows
And did it my way.

And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.
Of an age the world has long forgotten,
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada.
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along,
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song.
When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada,
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again,
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay.

And soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again,

Granada tierra soniada por mi.
Mi cantarse vuelve hitana cuando es para ti.
Mi cantar hecho de fantasia.
Mi cantar flor de melancholia que yo te vengo adar.
Granada tierra ensangrentada de sangre de toros.
Mi bello conserva el embrujo de los ojos moros.
Resuello rebelde hita0no y lleno de flores, y beso tu boca de grana,
Tu blanco manzana que habla de amores.
Granada manola hitana de coplas preciosas.
No tengo otra cosa que darte que un rama de rosas.
De rosas de suave fragancia que alleje amargo la virgen morena.
Granada tu tierra esta llena de lindas mujeres de sangre del sol..

Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song.
Just bet a bob-tailed bay,
Two-forty as his speed,
Hitch him to an open sleigh
and crack! You'll take the lead.

High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust
Of yesterday
The music
Of the years
Gone by

Chorus:

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song.
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you.
When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration.
But that was long ago, and now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song.
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew.
Though I dream in vain, in my heart you will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.

My God what have we done to You?

We always try to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put You through

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Angels with silver wings
Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you

If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through

Things get damaged
Things get broken

But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

This bed of sinfulness

What is it you want

Visits me each night
And won't be satisfied
Won't be denied

A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside

When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude
I'm not the one

Are you having your fun

The wild boys are calling on their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to a dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory, reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail because there's murder (murder)
By the roadside in a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us, looks like they'll try again

Wild boys.. never lose it
Wild boys.. never chose this way
Wild boys.. never close your eyes
Wild boys.. always shine


You got sirens for a welcome, there's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while you're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell?
And lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you, looks like they'll try again

Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

In pictures of living, in bloodshot a vision
Sweet miracles and strange circumstances
I see the sun up, the showdown, the cool winds that blow down
On the big beat that life-long romance is
You've got a gun in your hand, you're making self plans
Stay with me all through the night
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be apart of me, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

You can't stop the world for a boy or a girl
Sweet victims of poor circumstances
But you can pour back the love, sweeping down from above
Giving hope and making more chances
Well, I hope and I pray that maybe someday
You'll come back down here and show me the way
Control yourself, love is all you need
Control yourself, open up your heart
Open up your heart
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Sanctify yourself, set yourself free

I can feel the thunder storms inside
I wake every morning and the cold winds cover me
All I've got's a ghost of what could be

If you can see the lights shine in front of me
If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be

I'm in a broken dream I stare out into space
You know I called you up cos nothing takes your place
I've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside
I want to tell you love I'm too proud to cry

If you can see the lights shine in front of me
If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be
Summer's gone and I can't tell you lies
Oh forgive me love I'm too proud to cry

If you can see the lights shine in front of me

There's something you should know
I just found my new direction
And I hope you like the key
Like the air that led me to it
She's like the wind that sucked me through it
She's a river and she's turning there in front of me

Stand back - get back
She'll paint your blue skies black
She gives bullet proof protection
Got a resurrection feel
When I'm scared, and 'bout to lose
She gives me travelling shoes
She's a river and she's turning in front of me
And I go blind
Wasting my time
While the rivers in front of me
That's where I'm goin' to be

Shine on, get on
Twilight from dusk to dawn
She's the spirit of creation
She's the last chance guarantee
Got a myriad of poses
Sweet miracles and roses
She's a river and she's turning in front of me

'Cause when I find
My state of mind
The river's in front of me

They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
My heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon
My nerves just feel electrified
Meet me on the staircase
Outside a darkened room
Light me like a naked flame
The voice of Mother Nature states
All things must pass
And nothing can remain
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride

You raise me like a building to the very top
Rush me to the end of time
You fill me full of danger
You give me future shock
Then you leave me wasted dying

And I go blind
Wasting my time
The river's in front of me

What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well I used to know a girl
And I could have sworn that
Her name was Veronica
Well she used to have
A carefree mind of her own and
A delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid
She's not even sure
If her name is Veronica
CHORUS:
Do you suppose,
That waiting hands on eyes,
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs
At those who shout
Her name and steal her clothes

Did the days drag by?
Did the favours wane?
Did he roam down the town
All the time?
Will you wake from your dream,
With a wolf at the door,
Reaching out for Veronica
Well it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street
Where she lived
And a young man sailed on
A ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica

On the ""Empress of India""
And as she closed her eyes
Upon the world and
Picked upon the bones
Of last week's news
She spoke his name out loud again

Repeat chorus

Veronica sits in her favourite chair and
She sits very quiet and still
And they call her a name
That they never get right and
If they don't then nobody else will
But she used to have
A carefree mind of her own,
With devilish look in her eye
Saying ""You can call me
Anything you like,
But my name is Veronica""

The best of plans mislaid

The life was cheap on bread and wine
And sharing meant no shame

Of rockets flying from nearby
And scared she clings onto her dreams
To beat the fear that she might die

And who will have won
When the soldiers have gone
From the Lebanon

Before he leaves the camp he stops
He scans the world outside
And where there used to be some shops
Is where the snipers sometimes hide
He left his home the week before
He thought he'd be like the police
But now he finds he is at war
""Weren't we supposed to keep the peace""

I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again

But when I want sincerity
Tell me where else can I turn

But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore younger man's clothes""

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
As a smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davi who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As a businessman slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Chorus

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world.

It's hard when you're always afraid,
You just recover when another belief is betrayed.
So break my heart of you must......

You can't go the distance,
With too much resistance.
I know you have doubts,
But for God's sake don't shut me out.

This time you've got nothing to lose.
You can take it, you can leave it,
Whatever you choose....
I won't hold back anything,
And I'll walk a way a fool or a king.
Some love is just a lie of the mind.
It's make believe until its only a matter of time.
And some might have learned to adjust,
But then it never was a matter of trust.

I'm sure you're aware love,
We've both had our share of,
Believing too long,
When the whole situation was wrong.

Some love is just a lie of the soul.
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control.
After you've heard lie upon lie,
There can hardly be a question of why.
Some love is just a lie of the heart.
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start.

Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie
Remember Baker
They left their childhood
On every acre
And who was wrong?
And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick
Of the fight

We held the day
In the palm
Of our hand
They ruled the night
And the night
Seemed to last as long as
Six weeks on Parris Islands

We held the coastline
They held the highlands
And they were sharp
As sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together

Right at this moment I´m totally cool
Clear as a crystal, sharp as a knife
I feel like I´m in the prime of my life
Sometimes it feels like I´m going too fast
I don´t know how long this feeling will last
Maybe it´s only tonight

(Chorus:)
Darling, I don´t know why I go to extremes
Too high or too low there ain´t no in-betweens
And if I stand or I fall
It´s all or nothing at all
Darling, I don´t know why I go to extremes

Sometimes I´m tired, Sometimes I´m shot
Sometimes I don´t know how much more I´ve got
Maybe I´m headed over the hill
Maybe I´ve set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

(Chorus)

Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I´m wrong or I´m perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?

If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers,
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""

Tell her you wish you were there

Pay her some attention

For so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Who's made mistakes

Could be the difference that it makes

That it can only be seen

We all start in the streams

Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I've walked the Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said it only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
Hey, but I might just be the lunatic your looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
You may be right

I remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Cuz you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you've tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
But if I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You're getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood
It's alright, it's alright, sometimes that's what it takes
You're only human, you're allowed to make your share of mistakes
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)

You better believe there will be times in your life
When you'll be feeling like a stumbling fool
So take it from me you'll learn more from your accidents
Than anything that you could ever learn at school

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner of later you'll get your second wind

It's not always easy to be living in this world of pain
You're gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again
It's alright, it's alright, though you feel your heart break
You're only human, you're gonna have to deal with heartache
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)

Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own

Don't forget your second wind
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in

You've been keeping to yourself these days
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on 'till that old second wind comes along
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself
It's alright, it's alright, sometimes that's all it takes
We're only human, we're supposed to make mistakes
(You're only human, ooo-ooo)

But I survived all those long lonely days
When it seemed I did not have a friend
Cause all I needed was a little faith
So I could catch my breath and face the world again

Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in
(One more time!)
Don't forget your second wind
Sooner or later you'll feel that momentum kick in

Don't forget your second wind

He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As she goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you

Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

I remember you said:
""Sometimes it lasts in love, sometimes it hurts instead""

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bitter-sweet
This would taste?

I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero we've got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Been working down the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far,
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.

You see my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say his body's too young to look like this
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did.

You've got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We have got to make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast feel like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone,
be someone

You've got a a fast car
And we go cruising entertain ourselves,
You still ain't got a job
Now I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast feel like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I had the feeling that I belonged
And I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone,
be someone

You've got a fast car
And I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar see more of your friends
Than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I've got no plans and I aint going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

But times there were when I thought not
Bleeding half my soul in bad company
I thank the moon I had the strength to stop

I'm not making love to anyone's wishes
Only for that light I see
'cause when I'm dead and lowered
Low in my grave, that's gonna
Be the only thing that's left of me

And if I make it to the waterside
Will I even find me a boat (or so)?
And if I make it to the waterside
I'll be sure to write you not or something

Oh I'm on my way, I know I am
Somewhere not so far from here
All I know is all I feel right now
I feel the power growing in my hair

Oh life is like a maze of doors and they all
Open from the side you're on
Just keep on pushing hard boy
Try as you may
You're going to wind up where you started from

No one to help you, your friends don't have the time
So you ride around in your car. switch on the radio
You want to relate to something you once read in a book
What kind of a way to try to take a look

Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face grey
Until I got hurt, 'till got hurt, why didn't I
I didn't think of this until I got hurt
'Till I got hurt. baby. I didn't know' what love is

You say you want to learn to laugh 'cause music makes you cry
But the tears you shed are only in your eye
So you turn to any phoney mouth with a tale to tell
But he's just a hoaxer don't you know, selling peace and religion
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum

Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, I did not know what to do

Young son, don't let me down, young son
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now
Hold on, never let go, now hold on
Turn your heart to the bright sun
Love will come your way
Cos 'till you make that final show
You'll never know what love you've been missing
Missing

You say you want to seek the truth but you work alone
No one to help you and nobody to push you on
So you sit at home drinking your wine, television on
You wait for a miracle, cos you say one day one'll come along
(But wishful thinking, boy) any minute now You might be gone
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong

And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help
Who knows where that might lead

I fall at your feet
And you let your tears rain down on me

In white houses

Maybe I'm a little bit over my head
I come undone at the things he said
And he's so funny in his bright red shirt
We were all in love
And we all got hurt
I sneak into his car's black leather seat
The smell of gasoline in the summer heat
Boy, we're going way too fast
It's all too sweet to last

It's alright
And I put myself in his hands
But I hold on to secrets in white houses
Love, or something ignites in my veins
And I pray it never fades

Rush of blood, oh,
and a little bit of pain
On a cloudy day
It's more common than you think
He's my first mistake

Maybe you were all faster than me
We give each other up so easily
Sealing little wounds we'll never mend

So I go, and I will not be back here again
I'm gone as the day is fading

Then you listen to the music and you like to sing along,
You want to get the meaning out of each and ev'ry song
Then you find yourself a message and some words to call your own
And take them home.

He can make you love, he can get you high
He will bring you down, then he'll make you cry
Somethin' keeps him movin', but no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go.

The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
But he never seems to notice he's just got to find
Another place to play,
Anyway got to play, anyway Got to play.

Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out

Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there's no answer
And now I know my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected

Now I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire
And now I know my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a damn if I go

Came into my heart
You turned,
And you walked, just walked away

Then gave me faith, but took my hope
Look at me now

Hoping he hadn't changed his mind

Chased darkness out of view
left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too
I know you do
I've got so much more to give
this can't die, I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me
and I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

Chorus
I wanna love you forever
and this is all I'm asking of you
ten thousand lifetimes together
is that so much for you to do?
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
and felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew.
I'm gonna to love you forever.

My mind fails to understand
what my heart tells me to do
and I give up all I have just to be with you
and now I do
I've always been taught to win
and I never thought I'd fall
be at the mercy of a man
I've never been
now I only want to be right where you are.

let's take this night before its gone like yesterday
'Cause when I'm with you
there's no where else that I would ever wanna be
I'm craving for the next second I can feel you loving me

Don't turn away
It doesn't have to end today
Don't say goodbye

We'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes
And I'll be where you are

Don't say goodbye

Can you feel my desire?
The way that my body's aching
With your every breath
I try to memorize
Every move you're making
So I'll never forget
The way that you feel
Whenever your heart is beating with mine
Wherever I go
I'll keep my memories of you inside

We'll see the same stars
Just close your eyes
And I'll be where you are

The rising of the sun
We'll be together soon
Our story's just begun
Time will bring us near
I'll never be so far
Oh, baby, don't you fear
I'll always be right where you are

No me digas adios
Quedate aqui conmigo

Adios no es una palabra para nosotros
No te vallas
Quedate aqui conmigo

He came for the glory
She came looking for a young man's hand

And endless nights
And men just used her innocent ways
He found it all so pretty, hypnotized by the city
They lost sight of the reason
They lost count of the days

And they were two Souls searching for each other
One spirit looking for the other
Caught between a hard hard place and a rock

Still the city didn't acquiesce to his demands

The city smacked her hands

He met her one endless night
Her eyes had a light
There was something familiar about the smell of her skin
He held her tighter and tighter
As he danced inside her
She knew from the moment that she let him in

And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
Or keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness

Because none of it was ever worth the risk, but

Cause I’ve failed and I’m ready to be shown how

Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some strangers down
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

We always need to hear both sides of the story

A neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister, and says ""looks like it's just us from now on""

We always need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
'til you hear both sides

Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the centre of the storm
Neighbours once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat

We always need to hear both sides of the story

And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
'til you hear both sides

White man turns the corner, find himself within a different world
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall
He says ""would you respect me if I didn't have this gun
'cos without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one""

He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned
Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less travelled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
If today was your last day

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause
There's no second try
So live like you're never livin twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late

Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you had?
Would you call those friends you've never seen?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one your dreaming of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you'll finally fall in love?
If today was your last day

If today was your last day
Would you make it up by mending a broken heart
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes

A moment in this life
Let nothing stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

I'm gonna sing those songs
That offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser

I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny
With her bleach blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile

Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with a jagged edge
I'm telling you that
It's never that bad
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure
You can take this anymore

So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And if you can't tell
And you scare yourself
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Oh, honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
Cause I have faith in you
That you're going to make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come

When everybody's tired of being alone
And everybody's been abandoned

So if you're ever barely hanging on

My mind was closing, now I'm believing

To see the side of me that no one does or ever will

Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you’d be mine
But here we are, we’re here tonight

Singing Amen, I’m alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
We’d see the day when nobody died
And I’m singing

Amen I, I’m alive
Amen I, I’m alive

And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We’ll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along

Singing Amen I’m alive

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride

And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be

If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride

I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up
so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see
the parts of you that I've been kissing

Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go
by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel
while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her
not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered ""what was that?""
The wind, I think
'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
""That's my dad outside the car!""
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad
it was her mouth that I was kissing

Beer bottles layin on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon, oh!

Better hang on if you're taggin along
Cause we'll be doing this till six in the morning

Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass cause I paid the rent
So I doubt, he'll kick me out this afternoon

but have the best times
and hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down,
so we can do it all again

taking too much space

I used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me,
And think solely about themselves,
And you were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time.
I used to say the more tragic the better.
The truth is, whenever I think of the early 90's,
Your face comes up with a vengeance like it was yesterday.

Dear Terrance, I love you muchly.
You've been nothing but open hearted,
And emotionally available and supportive,
And nurturing, and consummately there for me.
I kept drawing you in and pushing you away,
I remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep on your couch,
And cry in front of you for the first time.
You were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself.
What was wrong with me?

Dear Marcus, you rocked my world.
You had a charismatic way about you with the woman,
And you got me seriously thinking about spirituality.
And you wouldn't let me get away with kicking my own ass.
But I could never really feel relaxed,
And looked out for around you, though,
And that stopped us from going any further than we did.
And it's kinda too bad,
Because we could've had much more fun.

Dear Lou, we learned so much.
I realize we won't be able to talk for some time,
And I understand that as I do you.

And we did as well as we could.

the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in
the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a
scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being
the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
be careful what you do because the lie becomes the
truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, law was on
her side.
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes
and her plans.
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think
twice
(Do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, she
looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like
mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me, just the smell of sweet
perfume.
This happened much too soon. She called me to her
room.

You know just lately this happy song it came along
And I like to somehow try and tell you.

Would you love her ? Yes, I would, Sir.

A Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew.
And he knows he shouldn't kill,
And he knows he always will,
Kill you for me my friend and me for you.

He's fighting for France,
He's fighting for the USA,
And he's fighting for the Russians,
And he's fighting for Japan,
And he thinks we'll put an end to war this way.

And he's fighting for Democracy,
He's fighting for the Reds,
He says it's for the peace of all.
He's the one who must decide,
Who's to live and who's to die,
And he never sees the writing on the wall.

But without him,
How would Hitler have condemned him at Labau?
Without him Caesar would have stood alone,
He's the one who gives his body
As a weapon of the war,
And without him all this killing can't go on.

He's the Universal Soldier and he really is to blame,
His orders come from far away no more,
They come from here and there and you and me,
And brothers can't you see,
This is not the way we put the end to war.

To please that girl and be her only man, see
She cheers me up when I feel alone
And that's why baby I've got to let you know

Found it in you, baby, you, my dear

My 16th birthday I was so shy
Not yet a man but ready to try
Music playing people saying
I looked around she caught my eye
Walked into the room I couldn't hardly see
There she was moving closer to me
She told me her name before I could speak
Took my hand and then she said these words to me

Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light
That's waht she said me
Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light

Hey beautiful girl so lovely tonight
Show me the way show me the light
Music playing people swaying
Next thing I knew we started to groove
Dancing and dancing moving so free
A feeling of love had come over me
I held her close and knew it was right
What a perfect surprise I had finally seen the light

(repeat)

Tonight, you will finally see the light baby
Tonight, you will finally see the light baby

How Could You put him up to the Ghetto Karmasutra?
How Could You put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How Could You How Could You just forget bout me?

You got alot of nerve (to think that i'm gone chill after at the shyt i heard),

I could've married you,
Good thing i found out before i bought that 7karate for ya,

but that's not the case, all I'm sayin

do it anyway you want, baby take it slowly
front to back, side to side, criss cross
get creative with it girl do your thang
put it down like you love me
let your fingers do the walkin
and your lips do the talkin in my ear
tell me what I wanna hear

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.

(Chorus)
Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go (x4)
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,
Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,
People passin' by they would stop and say
""Oh my but that little country boy can play""

(Chorus)

His momma told him ""some day you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around,
To hear you play your music till the sun go down,
Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin
'Johnny B. Goode' tonight""

What I'm asking for
Is by the next semester
Can I get another car ?
This one here is sick'ning
On a wide dual road.
I might as well be walking
As to drive this old Ford.

Almost everyntime I try
To go and pass a truck,
If I ain't goin' down hill,
Dad, Im, out of luck.
And even if I get by,
It's still a rugged risk,
The way this old Ford
Keep a hitting and miss.

Last week when I was driving
On my way to school,
I almost got a ticket
'Bout a freeway traffic rule.
It's now a violation
Driving under forty-five,
And if I push to fifty,
This here Ford will nosedive.

Dad, I'm in great danger
Out here trying to drive.
This Ford wiggles
When I'm approaching forty-five/
I have to nurse it along
Like a little suffering pup,
And cars whizzing by me,
Dad, look like I'm backing up.

She just don't have the appetite
For gas somehow,
And Dad, I got both carburetors
Hooked up on it now.
I tried to hook another
To see if I'd do a little good,
But ain't no place to put it
'Less I perforate the hood.

So Dad, send the money,
See what I can see,
Try to find a Cadillac,
Sixty-two or three.
Just something that won't worry us
To keep it on the road.
Sincerely, your loving son,
Henry Junior Ford.

And who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
Now they wonder
Why we didn't last

We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves

So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves
When everybody said to let it end
It makes me wonder
We can't let them win

I wanna make it up to you
No I'm
Never keeping secrets
Girl I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

I didn't want to lie to you
But I didn't want to let you down
It never did occur to me
Sooner or later that you would find out
You know how much I care for you
And I would never want to cause you pain
I know that there is no excuse
How could I ever treat my baby that way

That's why I'm telling everybody
That I know I was a fool
But I don't give a damn about it
'Cause I wanna get back wit you

HOOK

If you wanna go
I want you to know
Girl that I understand it
But I don't recommened it
'Cause I love you more
I know you can't ignore
That I will die for you
And lay down my life for you
Girl I wanna see
You standing next to me
Girl I apologize
For each and every lie
I want you to be
The only one for me
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

Feels good, everybody
Tender lover, tender love

Eleanor Rigby
Spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love it has a right to go

Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on
We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

Don't ever give up
In spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
There's more than enough
Keep lookin' for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

Sky is the limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so
Don't ever give in

So just stop your meddling”

You came along
And said that you would be my man

Now I'm jumping up and down
Spinning all around
Because of you, babe
I'm as happy as can be
And it's definitely
Because of you, babe
Just because of you

I used to go to bed at night
Wishing I had a friend
Someone to hold and squeeze me tight
A very special friend
Until you, you came along
And told me you would be the one
Until you, you came along
And held me in your arms

""Hello Dr. Greenthumb, paging Dr. Greenthumb!""

[B-Real]
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
but fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus:

[B-Real] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
[SenDog] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
[B-Real] I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
[SenDog] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
[B-Real] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
[SenDog] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
[B-Real] I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
[SenDog] Aiyyo Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time!

[B-Real]
People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
but thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
in the backyard or inside with hydro
To the cush plant brushin a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I wanna leave it alone
but never ever ever got a warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus 1/2

[B-Real]
Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get knocked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus

Dr. Greenthumb
Doctor, your Bulova plant needs special tending to
Doctor, we need more oxygen we need more CO2
Doctor, Dr. Greenthumb you're needed

Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigger

Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold

Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls
And you're coughing up a lung anyhow

You can't shake

And it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin', goin', gettin' to the roots

So turn me loose
But then again I got a story
That's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust

Where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland

Invaded by the wack diddie wack
Fooled the black, left us faded

Because of dat now I grit my teeth
So here's a song to the strong
'Bout a shake of a snake
And the smile went along wit dat
Can't truss it
Kickin' wicked rhymes
Like a fortune teller
'Cause the wickedness done by Jack
Where everybody at
Divided and sold
For liquor and the gold
Smacked in the back
For the other man to mack
Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory
Little Rock where they be
Dockin' this boat
No hope I'm shackled
Plus gang tackled
By the other hand swingin' the rope
Wearin' red, white and blue Jack and his crew
The guy's authorized beat down for the brown
Man to the man, each one so it teach one
Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
One love who said it
I know Whodini sang it
But the hater taught hate
That's why we gang bang it
Beware of the hand
When it's comin' from the left
I ain't trippin' just watch ya step
Can't truss it
An I judge everyone, one by the one
Look here come the judge
Watch it here he come now
I can only guess what's happ'nin'
Years ago he woulda been
The ships captain
Gettin' me bruised on a cruise
What I got to lose, lost all contact
Got me layin' on my back
Rollin' in my own leftover
When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else's
90 F--kin' days on a slave ship
Count 'em fallin' off 2, 3, 4 hun'ed at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it (think I'll every quit)
Still I pray to get my hands 'round
The neck of the man wit' the whip
3 months pass, they brand a label on my ass
To signify
Owned
I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555
How I'm livin'
We been livin' here
Livin' ain't the word

Haven't got
Classify us in the have-nots
Fightin' haves
'Cause it's all about money
When it comes to Armageddon
Mean I'm getting mine
Here I am turn it over Sam
427 to the year

That's why it's hard
For the black to love the land

It's another record, check it, mad methods
To put my brothers and sisters on a deathbed
You know he cheated, took what he wanted but now you blunted
Suckin up to the devil steppin down a level
It's who they fear is you
Who protects us from us and you from you
Yes and it counts [fuck the fourty ounce]
I sued them bastards, yeah they got bounce
I did em like a demo {threw em out the window}
I took a 98 cause I never liked a limo
But pump pump pump pu-pump pump it up
A mad rhyme, for mad times, that's what's up
Some ain't gonna change, I got em in a range
I gotta rearrange, so I'm buildin back your brain
Wreckin records with funky stuff
Am I loud enough? {yeah} You got ta give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

Verse Two: Chuck D

Come again with the same old bounce
I'm calling a foul and once again it counts
Mad tense mad tense brothers know
The blunts in the back got the black behind and that's wack
[And once again it's on!]
Hey Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin ""I don't care"", it's on
I'm comin with a rhyme [what?] I'm lettin go a rhyme [yeah!]
I gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times
Call me a Hannibal lecture, yes I checked her
They don't hear me though, so here I go
I'm sick and tired so Sly'll take ya higher
When I'm takin his sound to bring you down
Rappers rippin a lyrical kickin finger-lickin
But to the rhythm I'm givin but never cotton pickin
Like James Brown I'm sayin it loud
Am I loud enough? Huh, you got ta give it up

[Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never ever change
Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna NEVER EVER change!]

Chorus [1/2X]

Interlude: Chuck D, Flavor Flav

And when I'm coming, some young dumb and fulla cum
Some second guessing my lessons about saving young
Some don't know like Run said so here we go
Where it is inside, whoop there it is
{aaaaaaah} There it is
[There it is, damn right
My man X is a bad mother {shut your mouth)
I'm talking about Terminator, he's the man]
There it is, can you hit me off with another one

Chorus

I never did represent doing dumb shit
Some gangsta lying - I'd rather diss Presidents
Dead or alive, bring em and I'll swing em
I vocalize, I just rap, I don't sing em
Flick em, and I fling em, you can go with em
Hall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing em
Go Grandmama, close but no cigar
I got mine, for I'm using my rhyme
The flow go wherever I want, and that's clever
Give a piece of my time, to prevent some crime
And who behind puttin the guns to the young ones
The ones that make em is the ones that take em
Rugged for no reason, down in duck season
I don't want my mama, on the street wearing armor
So check yaself before ya wreck yaself
Respect yaself, hah, you got ta give it up

Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where anywhere I did pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, which is a clip, who wanna hit?
They got 'em quick, I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I threw in graves, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played out was a sad one
And always wanted to live like just a fat one

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
A ghetto bastard, born next to the projects
Livin' in the slums with bums, I sit and watch them
Why do I have to be like this? momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, and it's just for being a nice kid
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
Last stop to hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and napsack
Four squad stolen in cars in a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say somethin' positive? Well positive ain't where I lived
I lived right around a corner from west hell
Two blocks from south shit, it was in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was home sweet home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids for cause of chrome
Some life, it you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice than dope for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble any game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and goin' in on and knowin' not now
How will I do it, how will I make it? I won't, that's how
Why me, huh?

[Chorus]

My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead, huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fightin', lightin' up the streets at night
Playin' hide and seek with a machetti ??? like Freddy swipe
Some say I'm rollin' on, nothin' but a dog now
I answer that with a tech, who wanna bow-wow?
'Cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than I fly flowin' in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song?
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man to man talk just hot damn
If you ain't live you couldn't feel it, so kill it, skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
And illtown fell like I stuck-up props, got shot
Don't worry, I hit Bob, flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast
They changin' schools, I'm the misfit that will outlast
But that's cool with the bull, smack 'em backwards
That's what you get for fuckin' with a ghetto bastard

[Outro]
If you ain't ever been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
'Cause you ain't understand the ghetto
And stay the fuck out of the ghetto

My thoughts are thundering, tumblin
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling ta mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary, as I roll reality thru galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of oiu
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
from Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
lifers, Rikers ta foesome
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening to slow
I'm abrupting construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin 'bout an obstruction or turning something of nothing
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin me up

Chorus:

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest

Verse 2: Vin Rock

My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff, you get rushed, you
get bust
You call yourself callin my bluff, enough's enough
I'm puttin it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning
my skills, niggas I been rockin since lee twillz
and we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find
thinkin
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme shrinkin
The sleepin MC I eat like good 'n' plenty
Lyrically spankin ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
they begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lesser, a man should never challenge a clan
wit thirteen years experience of rippin mic's put in our hands

Detroit niggas are the craziest
Miami niggas are the craziest
Little Rock niggas are the craziest
Oak Town niggas are the craziest

Verse 3: Treach

I got barbarians to bogard me in
at a club that barred me when
a broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard
A brim is broke to the back I brawl and band from brains ta balls
Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells BOOM like Beirut
Assume the same suit, fuck that fly shit wit the flavor ca shi
Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique
You ain't rolling if our tape ain't what ya ride wit
Niggas snipe shit so I'm on a knife tip
Like the youngsters 'bout ta take you on some hip-hop ride shit
If you ain't jumpin then don't pump it

I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People...scratch'n temple
The last P...well...that's not that simple huh
It's sorta like a, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that I'm missin' here
You get it on occassion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start the explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, some other people's pu... You get it?
There's no room for relationships there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at?

The first two letters are the same but the last is something
different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanness and meanness
I won't get into that, I'll do it...uh...sorta properly
I'll say the last P...hmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me
exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with it, discount

that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said I'll look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cos you knew I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP visit with him or her
For sure, I'm going to admit it: When OPP comes,
Damn skippy, I'm wit' it

While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle

I am the man-ner of the family cuz the pants fit

Wave the eighteen mill', eat a still

Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd throw the J
Lay it low and late night I get sessed
Uncondition my ways, of the everyday sunset
Wagin my days, to the one bet
Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
cause the days of the breaks, be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm EXPLODING

I be the fab I be the fabulous but see unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name ""ah one two, ah one two""
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
latchin on to when I caught the fame ""ah one two, ah one two""
Pass the task to ask me bout the Native Tongue again my friend

my home got jacked

but I didn't have a chance
You know I wish i did

I'll just walk like a giant police defiant
you'll say to stop but I'll say that I cant

I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph

You don't like it, so you know where you can go
cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show

It was a joke brother the brutally died

But it was mine, so let me define

Don't try to act crazy

I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the King on the microphone so is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like Slam dunks take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go,
Cause it's Basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow,

Chours

I used to go to dinner, and then take the girl,
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl,
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West,
To play Basketball at it's very best,
Basketball has always been my thing,
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King,
And number 33, my man Kareem,
Is the center on my starting team,

(To the hoop, ya'll, Watch out, Watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete,
Now these players, could never be beat,
Isiah, and Iceman too,
Just give 'em the ball, and then you talk up too,
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene,
And Ralph Sampson is really mean,
Bill Russell didn't take no junk,
and Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk,
Tell me, were you in the joint?,
The night Wilt scored 100 points,
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back,
And didn't give nobody, no kind of slack,
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team,
With moves that came right out of a dream,
Or when, Willis Reed stood so tall,
Playing D with desire, it's Basketball,

A'ight, stop whatcha doin'
'Cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to.
I look funny,
But yo, I'm makin' money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me.
Now gather 'round
I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground.
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.
And all the rappers in the top ten, please allow me to bump thee.
I'm steppin' tall, y'all,
And just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.
I like to rhyme,I like my beats funky,
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere - are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

{Chorus:}
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Verse Two:

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B,
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
Both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance.

{Chorus}

Breakdown:

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do - check it out

Verse Three:

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ""Ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty!""
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
Jig around, shakin' ya rump,
And when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
Tell him ""Step off, I'm doin' the Hump!""

{Chorus}

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stupid!

{Chorus}

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Outro:

Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
Keep on doin' the Humpty Dance,
And to the ladies,
Peace and humptiness forever

Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era?
Was fresh and fat since they started sayin outie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie

Man and woman, girl and boy, let us try to give a helping hand
This I know and I'm sure that the love we all could understand
This is our world, can't you see
Ev'rybody wants to live and be free
Instead of fussing and fighting, cheating back-biting
Scandalising and hating

Yeah, we could have a wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can repeat - mmh yeah yeah

We could have a wonderful world, beautiful people ....

Summer time and the livings easy
Bradley's on the microphone with ras M.G
All the people in the dance will agree that
We're well qualified to represent the LBC
G, me and Louie
Run to the party, dance to the rhythm
It gets harder

Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
I'm locked down like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin all over and when she gets home,
There's none left for me

Chorus

Oh take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will someday rise
So what am I gonna be doing for a wife
Said I'm gonna play it myself
Show them now we've come off the shelf.. so what

Chorus

Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil
Most definitely
Evil, HORNY, scandalous and evil

I'd like to hold her head underwater, oh

it might drive you crazy
but don't let it phase you no way (no way)

Each and every day I pray to get to know you please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty

Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around
to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe

I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
I Fight with all of my might
and get these demons to flee
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe

Out of darkness comes light,
twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till twilight
Said, thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart,
and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

[Chorus:]
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and
I Sing to my God, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now, time we start revealing

What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being
and I Sing to my God, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now

Strippin' away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life
but your brain moves slow

If you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full
then it's bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's
and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say
he couldn't be found
Searching up to the sky and looking
beneath the ground

Like a King without his Crown
You keep fallin' down
You really want to live
but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down
on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray,
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

[Chorus:]
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and

My love will rip a skylight in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and
I Sing to my God, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now

You keep my mind at ease
and my soul at rest, you're not vexed

Then I got my engines on
Say the word and darlin' we'll be gone
Outside the world is waitin'
But we won't lose control
So come on now - let the good times roll

You gotta ride your broom right into my room
Kick off your shoes make yourself at home
Wave your little wand - weave a little spell
Make a little magic - raise some hell

There will never be another tonight
C'mon baby - hold on tight
There will never be another tonight
I don't care if it's wrong or right
We got nothin' to lose just me and you
In your wildest dreams...
There'll never be another tonight

Who cares about tomorrow
Let the wind fill your sails
A runaway train ridin' on the rails
We got the bases loaded
Home run - power play
Tonight's the night we're goin' all the way

You gotta ride your broom right into my room
Kick off your shoes make yourself at home
Wave your little wand - weave a little spell
Make a little magic - raise some hell

There will never be another tonight
C'mon baby - hold on tight
There will never be another tonight
Flash your diamonds shine your lights
There'll never be another tonight
I don't care if it's wrong or right
Cause we got nothin' to lose just me and you
In your wildest dreams...
There'll never be another tonight

Others they're looking for inner light

Would come to stay and never wanna leave
But that's all changed - she's dealt the final blow
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love

It doesn't matter who was right or wrong
When the fire is over - when the magic's gone
You pick up the pieces and do the best you can

It knocks you down but you try it again
You get a little older it's a cryin' shame
Sometimes things don't work out like you plan

Who's gonna help when you've had enough
It ain't no secret you're a victim of love
Heaven knows what you were thinkin' of
Don't blame yourself you're just a victim of love

One goodbye was really all it took
Now you thumb through the pages of your little black book
But somehow all the numbers look the same
You've been thinkin' how to get around it
But there ain't nothin' you can do about it
Nothin' ventured - nothin' gained

Ain't nothin' you can't rise above
Call it what you want but you're a victim of love

Who's gonna help you when you've had enough
Ain't no secret you're a victim of love

Stealing down a wrong way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on on her feet
Well the cars do the usual dances
Sames old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah here she comes queens rollerball
Enchante what can I say don't care at all
You know she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud

She gets rock n roll a rock n roll station
And a rock n roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her wanna be the story
And the story was whatever was the song what it was
Rollergirl don't worry
D.j. play the movies all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says toro toro taxi see ya tomorrow my son
I swear she let a big truck graze her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her
She got her own world in the city
Cos the city's been so rude to her

Come slippin and a slidin
Life's a rollerball
Slippin and a slidin

The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
And kid you better get the picture
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home

When the change was made uptown
And the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city
All the little pretties raise their hands
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
With a Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out...

Can't see nothin' coming up behind
I make my way through this darkness
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me
Lost track of how far I've gone
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile line

Come on up for the rising
Com on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
Wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here

Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li

Spirits above and behind me
Faces gone, black eyes burnin' bright
May their precious blood forever bind me
Lord as I stand before your fiery light

Li,li, li,li,li,li, li,li,li

I see you Mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancin' in a sky filled with light
May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mix with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancin' on the end of the line

Sky of blackness and sorrow ( a dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness ( a dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear ( a dream of life)
Sky of memory and shadow ( a dream of life)
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life ( a dream of life)

Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight

I can feel the soft silk of your blouse
And them soft thrills in our little fun house
Then the lights go out and it's just the three of us
You me and all that stuff we're so scared of
Gotta ride down baby into this tunnel of love

There's a crazy mirror showing us both in 5-D
I'm laughing at you you're laughing at me
There's a room of shadows that gets so dark brother
It's easy for two people to lose each other in this tunnel of love

it ought to be easy ought to be simple enough
Man meets woman and they fall in love

And I'm soaking through and through

And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now

Because you're near me and

They go on loving you just the same, I know that somebody's trying.

So please, return the love you took from me.
Or please, let me know if it can't be me, I know when,
Somebody's lieing, I know when somebody's lieing.

( Guitar Solo )

I know that somebody's lieing, I know that somebody's lieing.
Give me a sign and let me know we're through.
If you don't love me like I love you.
But if you cry at night the way I do I'll know that somebody's lieing.
So please, return the love you took from me.
Or please, let me know if it can't be me.
I know when somebody's lieing, I know when somebody's lieing.

I know a thing or two - I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame It burns you when it's hot

Some fools fool themselves, I guess
They're not foolin' me

Hidin' out in my rented dream
Lookin' for attention

Ask the chauffeur who he knows
Numbers he's got, lots of those.

Tryin' to run from this halloween.

Sets his sights on the search of a lifetime

We drift apart for a little bit of a spell
One night I get a call and I know that you're well
And days I was down you would help me get out of my hole

Ohhhhhhhh

Let's be friends
Let's be friends
Let's be friends

You told me when my girl was untrue
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair

I've been taken for lost and gone and unknown for a long, long time.
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl,
From the Spanish and Indian home home of the heroes and villains.

Once at night, Catillian squared the fight,
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her
down.
But she's still dancing in the night, unafraid,
Of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains.

Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Heroes and villains, just see what you've done

Stand or fall, I know there shall be peace in the valley,
And it's all an affair of my life with the heroes and villains.

In the cantina, margaritas keep the spirit high.
There I watched her, she spun around and wound in the warmth,
Her body fanned the flame of the dance.
Dance, Margarita, don't you know that I'm in love with you
Dance
You're under arrest!

My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise.
They started slow, long ago, head-to-toe, healthy, wealthy, and often wise.
At three-score and five, I'm very much alive.
I've still got the jive to survive with the heroes and villains.

Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

The loneliness of a one night stand
Is hard to take
We all chase something
And maybe this is a dream
The timeless face of a rock and roll
Woman... while her heart breaks
Oh you know... the dream keeps coming
Even when you forget to feel

For me... it's the only life
That I've ever known
And love is only one... fine star away
Even though the living
Is sometimes laced with lies
It's alright
The feeling remains
Even after the glitter fades

Said why you always running
In place?

Tell my father

To make them realise
This is my life

After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see

Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I wouldn't miss you

What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

Wish I never would've said it's over

It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us
That get harder, and harder, and harder, and harder, and harder
To remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh

Lets not pretend that we're unique
Coz everybody's tasted loves illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the choas and confusion
And the love we feel
Is gettin' deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper
By the minute

But we let it slip away
Coz we don't know a good thing while we're in it

Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh
Ooh - Ooh

(Ending Background vocal:
""Y el amor que sentimos es mas profundo""
""The love that we feel is deeper"")

You've been through this before
An' you swore this time you'd think with your head
No one, would ever have you again
And if takin' was gonna get done
You'd decide where and when
Just when you think you got it down
Your heart securely tied and bound
They whisper, Promises In The Dark

Armed and ready, you fought love battles in the night
But too many opponents made you weary of the fight
Blinded by passion, you foolishly let someone in
All the warnings went off in your head
Still you had to give in

Just when you think you got it down
Resistance nowhere to be found
They whisper, Promises In The Dark

But promises, you know what they're for
It sounds so convincing, but you heard it before
Cause talk is cheap and you gotta be sure
And so you put up your guard
And you try to be hard
But your heart says try again

You desperately search for a way to conquer the fear
No line of attack has been planned to fight back the tears
Where brave and restless dreams are both won and lost
On the edge is where it seems it's well worth the cost
Just when you think you got it down
Your heart in pieces on the ground
They whisper, Promises In The -- Dark

Many times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone

Don't want to leave you really
I've invested too much time
To give you up that easy
To the doubts that complicate your mind

Chorus:

We Belong to the light
We Belong to the thunder
We Belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We Belong, We Belong
We Belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit
Do we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
When you say

(Chorus)

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Can figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words and make me want to cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed and I
Dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
Everything will be wonderful some day

Promises mean everything when you're little and the world's so big
I just don't understand how you can smile with all those tears in your eye
And tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everthing is wonderful now

Go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all ok
I laugh a lot so my friends wont know
But when the bell rings I just don't want to go home to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful some day

No. No. No.
No I don't want to meet your friend
I don't want to start over again

Just like it used to be
Somedays I hate everything

walking the block
I loved it when you held me tight
I loved to hear you talk

You woud take me to the movies
You would take me to the beach
take me to a place inside
that was so hard to reach

tell me where did you go
you had the world inside your hand
but you did not seem to know

tell me what do you see
When you look back at your wasted life
and you don't see me

I was ten years old
doing all that I could
It wasn't easy for me
to be a scared white boy in a black neighborhood

Sometimes you would send me a birthday card
with a five dollar bill
Yeah, i never understood you then
and i guess i never will

tell me how do you sleep
With the children you abandoned
and the wife i saw you beat

I will never be safe
i will never be sane
I will always be weird inside
i will always be lame

with a child of my own
And i swear that im not gonna let her know

We can go down to the bay
And together hand in hand
We will walk along the sand

There stood a long cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.

(Chorus)
Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go (x4)
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
Go sit beneath a tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sittin in the shade,
Strummin with the rhythm that the drivers made,
People passin' by they would stop and say
""Oh my but that little country boy can play""

(Chorus)

His momma told him ""some day you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around,
To hear you play your music till the sun go down,
Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin
'Johnny B. Goode' tonight""

I saw a pretty little thing approaching me
She said ""I've never seen a man
Who looks so all alone,
Could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price
Your evening will be nice,
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said ""You're such a sweet young thing
Why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said,

""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know I can't slow down,
I can't hold back,
Though you know, I wish I could.
Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Until we close our eyes for good"".

Not even fifteen minutes later
I'm still walking down the street,
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight.
And then he swept up from behind
He put a gun up to my head,
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
He said ""Give me all you've got
I want your money not your life,
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice.""
I told him ""You can have my cash
But first you know I got to ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""

Now a couple hours passed
And I was sitting at my house,
The day was winding down and coming to an end.
So I turned on the TV
And flipped it over to the news,
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
I saw a preacher man in cuffs he'd taken money from the church,
He stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills.
But even still I can't say much
Because I know we're all the same,
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.

You know, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
We got bills to pay,
We got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.

I awake and find you gone.

Is it any wonder that I feel so blue ue, ue

It would be thrilling if you were willing
And, if it can never be, pity me

I can't resist, you are temptation, I
Am yours, here is my heart
Take it and say that we'll never part
I'm just a slave, only a slave

To you, temptation
I'm your slave!!!

I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock!

And I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has
ever been made, and
I can make all your demons be gone

But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do

And if all those plans I've made
Don't melt the lady's heart

I'll put on the old 45's

And maybe the old songs
Will bring back the old times

Maybe the old lines will sound new

Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder
Maybe old feelings will come through

Maybe we'll start to cry and wonder why
We ever walked away

Maybe the old songs
Will bring back the old times

And make her wanna stay

It's been too long since I've
Seen her face light up when I come home

It's been too many hours
I've wasted staring at the phone

sweet old songs I'm counting on you
To bring her back to me

I'm tired of listening alone

And maybe the old songs
Will bring back the old times

Maybe the old lines will sound new

Maybe she'll lay her head on my shoulder

But all the time your face
Came back to haunt me
Day by day the feeling grew
I know I'm still in love with you
The further I go the more I know it
I wanna show it

Ship to shore
Do you read me anymore?
This line is bad, I'm fading
Ship to shore
Answer my call
Send me a signal
A beacon to bring me home

Moving fast all systems go
You and I had time to grow
Until there was a breakdown in transmission
How I wish that we could turn the clock back
To the times when we were lovers
In the true sense of the meaning
You must believe me

Ship to shore
Do you read me anymore?
This line is bad, I'm drowning
Ship to shore
Answer my call
Send me a signal
A beacon to bring me home

she be
Hoping that she might appear, out of nowhere
But you fail to see

All the hurt inside, the wounded pride
Ooh what she went through for you
You cheated and lied, as her love slowly died
And her heart just broke in two

When she was with you, all along
Behind you right or wrong
She tried to hold on, hold on
But you went too far, and she's gone

And now it's over and her heart turns to stone
No time for pity, when her heart turns to stone
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll do fine on her own

What you thought was a game
A game you were winning
Wouldn't go your way
Now you've lost what you had
And your back to the beginning
It's the price you have to pay

When she was with you, all along
Behind you right or wrong
She tried to hold on, hold on
But you went too far, and she's gone

And now it's over and her heart turns to stone
No time for pity, when her heart turns to stone
She cries a little as her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll get by on her own

She hides the pain
But her heart turns to stone
No time for pity
When her heart turns to stone
She cries sometimes
As her heart turns to stone
She's that kind of woman
She'll get by on her own

Yeah it's over
And her heart turns to stone
Don't look for pity now
When her heart turns to stone
Listen to her cry
Listen to her cry
She's a woman now
Ooh it's a sad thing to see
To see a heart turn to stone
The heart of a woman
A heart turned to stone

You raise me up
You kill me with your charms
