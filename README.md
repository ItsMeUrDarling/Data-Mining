Welcome to the repository of the "Programming Skill Demand Analysis" project. This project is aimed at understanding the correlation between job openings and the popularity of various programming languages.

#Project Objective

As a course provider, it's vital to keep track of industry trends to ensure the relevance and utility of our course offerings. In this project, we conducted an analysis on behalf of our client, Skillzguid, an online programming course provider, to help them align their courses more closely with market demand.

We utilized data analysis techniques and regression models to identify significant correlations between the prevalence of certain programming languages and the number of job openings requiring these skills. The results of this analysis will guide Skillzguid in prioritizing their course offerings based on job market demands.

#Methodology

We used a dataset containing information about the prevalence of programming languages and corresponding job openings. We then performed an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to identify the correlation between these two factors.

We've considered the following programming languages in our analysis: Julia, Python, PHP, R, and MATLAB.

#Findings
Our analysis found that there is a significant correlation between job openings and the prevalence of Julia, Python, R, and MATLAB, suggesting a strong market demand for these languages. However, PHP showed no significant correlation.

#How to Navigate this Repository
In this repository, you'll find our Python notebooks detailing the step-by-step process of our analysis, from data gathering and preprocessing to data analysis and interpretation.
