# The Ames Housing dataset analysis :houses::derelict_house::house::house_with_garden:

In the Ames Housing Project, the main problem we addressed was predicting house prices based on a variety of property features. This is a real-world problem, as real estate agencies, individual buyers and sellers, and even investors can benefit from accurate predictions of house prices.

For the task, we used two different models: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Ridge Regression.

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of machine learning algorithm that uses a set of mathematical functions known as kernels to predict a continuous output, in our case, house prices. It's especially effective when dealing with high-dimensional data, like we had with many property features in our dataset. It tries to fit the best line within a predefined margin, or 'buffer', to predict house prices, which helps in reducing the error.

Ridge Regression, on the other hand, is a technique used when there is multicollinearity (high correlation) among the independent variables in our dataset. By adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates, Ridge Regression reduces the standard errors which can help to reduce overfitting, a common problem in machine learning where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

In real life, these models can be used by a real estate company to more accurately price homes they are selling or buying. The company can input the relevant details of a house, such as its size, number of bedrooms, location, and other features, into the model, and it will output a predicted price. This can help the company make more informed decisions and potentially increase their profitability.

In essence, by applying SVR and Ridge Regression to the Ames Housing dataset, we were able to create models that could make reasonably accurate predictions about house prices based on property features. The methodologies we used can be applied to any situation where there's a need to predict a numerical value based on a set of features or inputs. This could include forecasting stock prices, predicting demand for products, or even estimating the progression of climate change.
